# Workout & Lesson Management System

This repository contains a simple Java-based project that models a workout management system. The system is built around two classes: `Workout` and `Lesson`, where each workout is made up of multiple lessons. The project also includes methods for generating dummy data for workouts and lessons.

## Features

- **Lesson Class**: Stores information about a specific workout lesson (e.g., title, duration, link, and image path).
- **Workout Class**: Represents a complete workout, which contains multiple lessons, total duration, calories burned, and a description.
- **Dummy Data Generation**: Functions like `getWorkout1`, `getWorkout2`, and `getWorkout3` create sample workouts with dummy data.
- **Get All Workouts**: The `getData` method returns a list of all workouts created using dummy data.
